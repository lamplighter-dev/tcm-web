    ========================================================================================

<p>
    ive decided to begin a weekly text-based devlog. ive never had a blog before, but the format has always been very enticing to me compared to social media.
</p>

<p>
    most devlogs on social media are either heavily edited youtube videos or short clips, both of which i think arent very well suited to the cruel mother. the game is more focused on building an atmosphere which just isn't captured right on social media
</p>

<p>
    i'll be using this to document the new features and changes i'm making to the game, but also just anything related to game development that has been on my mind. mostly, i just want to put something out there that shows im still working on the game.
</p>

<p>
    speaking of which, i am now getting very close to completing what i consider to be the first alpha build. this version is going to be used for playtesting with friends. not a public release, but it's a big milestone
