<p>
    it is so hard to keep a secret in a video game...
</p>

<p>
    i initially thought that creating a game in a custom engine would make it very difficult to peek behind the curtains, but this is mostly 
    untrue. there are plenty of reverse engineering programs that can take any .exe and decompile it into regular C code, albeit with comments and variable/function names
    removed.
</p>
    you can definitely make it harder to reverse engineer an application, but not impossible. for example, many of the assets in my game engine use a custom file format, so
    it takes a little extra work to understand the contents of a file. adding encryption can make this even more challenging
</p>

<p>
    datamining does add another way for people to enjoy a game, though. uncovering these secrets does require work and is still interesting even when exposed outside
    regular gameplay.
</p>

<p>
    and if people like a game enough that they're willing to spend that much time digging beneath the surface, that's probably a good thing.
